    <p>I am currently a senior at Benicia High School. I am a big runner and I am planning on pursuing chemical engineering in college. In highschool I have taken Intro to Engineering & Architecture, Advanced Engineering Honors, and I am currently taking AP Computer Science Principles. Through these classes and on my own Iâ€™ve completed many projects and I have some of those depicted here on my portfolio. </p>
